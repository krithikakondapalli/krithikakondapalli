## Hello, I'm Krithika! 👋 

I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Florida, passionate about building meaningful technology at the intersection of software engineering, AI/ML, and product management.

## 🔧 What I've Worked On
- DoneTogether – A collaborative goal-tracking platform (MERN stack + Clerk) that encourages peer accountability. I built responsive React components, integrated RESTful APIs, and followed agile & CI practices.
- StudyUp! – An educational mobile app built at SwampHacks 2025 using React Native and Expo. We gamified studying with tilt-based motion detection and smooth multiplayer setup for fast-paced review sessions.
